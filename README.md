# Bupropion-Model
Modeling of published clinical Bupropion studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model for bupropion (and its metabolites hydroxybupropion, erythorhydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion). The model was developed using published clinical studies and its predicted performance evaluated within our DDI network. The file contains simulations of the published clinical studies used during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports.For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/13/3/331)].
